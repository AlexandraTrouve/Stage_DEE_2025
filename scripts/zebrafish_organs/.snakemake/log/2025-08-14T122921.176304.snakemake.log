AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules sequences and neg_bed_files are ambiguous for the file ../../results/zebrafish_organs/sets/posSet/sequences/brain.fasta.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	sequences: s_type=posSet,sample=brain
	neg_bed_files: sample=brain
