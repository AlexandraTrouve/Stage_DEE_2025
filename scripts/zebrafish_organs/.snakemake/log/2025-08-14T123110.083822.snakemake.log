MissingOutputException in rule neg_bed_files in file "/Users/children/Desktop/Stage_2025/scripts/zebrafish_organs/Snakefile", line 62:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../../results/zebrafish_organs/sets/posSet/sequences/ovary.fasta (missing locally, parent dir contents: testis.fasta)
../../results/zebrafish_organs/sets/negSet/sequences/ovary.fasta (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job neg_bed_files since they might be corrupted:
../../results/zebrafish_organs/sets/negSet/bed_files/ovary.bed
Shutting down, this might take some time.
